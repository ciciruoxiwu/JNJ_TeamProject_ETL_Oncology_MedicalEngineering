# ETL-Oncology-Project

This is a team project under the collaboration between Johnson & Johnson and Purdue University(Data Mine Community). 

Background
The Primum & Analytics project aims to analyze oncology-patient conversations to extract meaningful insights that can inform medical strategy and marketing decisions. The ultimate goal is to establish a complete ETL pipeline for medical text engineering, which can be applied to future Primum data. This repository documents the process of extracting text from Excel, cleaning it, passing it through an NLP pipeline, and presenting the results with graphs.

The project results focus on three research areas:
1. Team 1: Medication Analytics - Understanding trends in medication usage.
2. Team 2: Patient Profiling - Extracting demographic data to categorize patient groups.
3. Team 3: Sentiment Analysis - Evaluating the emotional tone in patient conversations.
